Cuts a release: sets the version, runs the tests, records the release in a
commit and an annotated tag, and opens the next development version.
Nothing is pushed.

  ./create-release.sh [options]

The version released is the one pyproject.toml is already working towards,
with the development suffix dropped: 0.1.0.dev0 releases 0.1.0. It is shown
and confirmed before anything changes. What is opened afterwards is up to
--bump.

  --bump=revrevision  the third number, and the default: 0.1.0 opens
                      0.1.1.dev0.
  --bump=revision     the second, zeroing the third: 0.1.0 opens
                      0.2.0.dev0.
  --bump=version      the first, zeroing the rest: 0.1.0 opens
                      1.0.0.dev0.

  --skip-tests        do not run the tests. Nothing is verified: for a
                      release you have already tested.
  --help, -h          this.

Pushing the tag builds the Debian packages and the single-file executables
and publishes them as a GitHub release.
